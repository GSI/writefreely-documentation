# Show an Excerpt

You can show just the beginning of your post on your blog's home page with a special shortcode. For example, if you're on the "How to Use Write.as" blog's [home page](https://howto.write.as/), you'll see a "Read more..." link below each post.

To separate your home page excerpt from the rest of your post, simply add this shortcode into your post at the spot you want:

```
<!--more-->
```

Then, readers will see a "Read more..." link displayed in its place on your home page.

**Bonus**: just like the post date, the "Read more..." link will be translated into the language of your post, if it's one of the languages we support. For more information on this, check out the list of our [currently supported languages](https://poeditor.com/join/project/TIZ6HFRFdE).
