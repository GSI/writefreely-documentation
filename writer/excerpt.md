# Show an Excerpt

You can show only the beginning of your post on your WriteFreeely blog's home page with a bit of special text. For example, if you're on the "How to Use Write.as" blog's [home page](https://howto.write.as/), you'll see a "Read more..." link below each post.

To choose where your excerpt ends, simply add this text into your post at the spot you want:

```
<!--more-->
```
That's it!

**Bonus**: just like the post date, the "Read more..." link will be translated into the language of your post, if it's one of the [21 different languages](https://poeditor.com/join/project/TIZ6HFRFdE) we currently support.
