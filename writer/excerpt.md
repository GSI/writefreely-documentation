# Show an Excerpt

You can show only the beginning of your post on your WriteFreely blog's home page with a bit of special text. For example, if you're on the "How to Use Write.as" blog's [home page](https://howto.write.as/), you'll see a "Read more..." link below each post.

To choose where your excerpt ends, simply add this text into your post at the spot you want:

```
In this post I'm going demonstrate how to use the _Excerpt_ feature 
in WriteFreely. I'll simply add a special code at the spot I want 
this excerpt to end, and WriteFreely will create a "Read more" link 
for readers at that spot. <!--more-->

Now my post will continue here...
```
That's it!

**Bonus**: just like the post date, the "Read more..." link will be translated into the language of your post, if it's one of the languages we support. For more information on this, check out the list of our [currently supported languages](https://poeditor.com/join/project/TIZ6HFRFdE).
