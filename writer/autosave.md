# Auto-saving editor

The WriteFreely editor automatically saves your writing, so if you leave without saving, you'll pick up where you left off when you come back.

Writing automatically saves to the device you're writing on and works even with a spotty internet connection, so you'll always have access to your draft from the same device and browser that you started it on.
