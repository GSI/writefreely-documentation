# Autosave

The WriteFreely editor automatically saves your writing, so if you leave the editor without saving, you'll pick up where you left off when you come back.

Writing automatically saves to the device you're writing on and works even with a spotty internet connection, so you'll always have access to your draft from the same device and browser that you started it on.

This feature shines when you need it most. Whether your laptop shuts down unexpectedly or you suddenly lose power, auto-saving drafts can give writers peace of mind.
