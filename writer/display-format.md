# Display Format

WriteFreely gives you the same focused experience when you publish as when you write. Custom display formats allow you to take full control of what your writing looks like.

## Getting Started

Go to your _Blogs_ page and select the _Customize_ option under your first blog. Once on the "Customize" page, scroll down to see an option called _Display Format_. This is where you can configure how your posts are shown.

Let's look at some of the different display format options.

## Blog

This is the classic ordering for a blog: latest posts at the top with dates shown. It's perfect for when you want readers to see your most recent post when they arrive on your site.

You can use this format for more than traditional blogs. Many utilize it for keeping friends and family updated with their writing or posting about upcoming events.

## Novel

This format hides dates and puts things in chronological order, so readers see the first thing you wrote first.

This is perfect for serial forms of writing. Each post can be an individual chapter or section of a larger piece. Whether it be a story or a work of non-fiction, "Novel" guides people to read the work in the order you intended.

## Notebook

Like "Novel", the dates are hidden. However, this keeps the most recent posts at the top as "Blog" does.

Some writing can still be chronological while not needing to be labeled by a date. Poets who want to put out evergreen poetry over time while keeping the home page of their blog fresh for incoming readers would find this format useful. "Notebook" also works for a private blog where you just want to jot down ideas.

## Multiple Blogs

If your WriteFreely site supports multiple blogs, you can have three blogs with different formats and functions.

The first blog could be where your writing about programming lives ("Blog"), the second blog could be used as a place where you record quotes you find interesting  (“Notebook”), and the third could be for that novel you are writing for NaNoWriMo (“Novel”).
