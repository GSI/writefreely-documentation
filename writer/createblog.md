# Creating a Blog

WriteFreely makes it easy to publish under multiple identities, so you can separate your writing by audience and express yourself more freely -- all from a single account, with your privacy intact.


## Getting Started

The first thing to do is make sure that your instance supports you to create multiple blogs. If it does, then log in to your WriteFreely site and click _Blogs_ on the top menu. Once on your _Blogs_ page, you'll notice a _New Blog_ option under your first blog. Click it and you will be prompted to fill in the name of ypir blog. Fill in a unique name for it and click the _Create_ button.

Once you click the _Create_ button you will see the blog appear in the list of blogs on your _Blogs_ page. You just created a new blog!

## Title & Alias

There are a couple things to know about your newly created blog. Each WriteFreely blog comes with an alias and a title. Both of these are taken from the name you gave your blog when you created it.

The alias is the unique and unchangeable slug in your blog's url. In the previous example, the name "Blog for Writing" creates the alias "blog-for-writing". This will appear in the URL. For example, if your WriteFreely site URL is `example.com`, then your blog URL will be `example.com/blog-for-writing`. The title is the title displayed on your blog. If you want a particular alias for your blog, you should enter that when creating a blog, and then go to the new blog's _Customize_ page and change the title to what you want.

To continue upon the previous example, we can go to the new blog's _Customize_ page and change the blog's title from "Blogs for Writing" to "Blogs for Typing". Notice how the new title appears on the blog but the alias is still "blog-for-writing":

## Identity

When you create a new blog, it is a unique, individual identity. No reader can see that your blogs come from the same account. Only you know through your _Blogs_ page. This means that each blog can be used however you want.
