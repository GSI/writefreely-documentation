# Publicity

Whether you want to keep your writing completely private, limited to a certain audience, or sent out to the world wide web, WriteFreely can help with flexible blog publicity settings.

## Getting Started

If you go to your blog's _Customize_ page, you will see a section labeled _Publicity_. This is where you can configure who gets to see your blog. To change, all you need to do is click the checkbox of your preferred publicity setting and then scroll down to select "Save Changes."

Let's explore the different options provided.

## Unlisted

This means that anyone with your blog's link can read your posts. Will future-employers be looking at your blog? Do you mainly distribute your posts through social media? Link to your blog on your personal site? “Unlisted” is a great fit in all of these cases.

## Private

What if you want your blog to be a digital journal? A private space where you can write without anyone looking over your shoulder? Make your blog “Private”. This means that nobody else can read the blog but you, and only when you're logged in.

## Password Protected

What if you want your blog to be read only by some people? A place for drafts that only trusted confidants could see? Make your blog “Password Protected”. This meets somewhere in-between “Unlisted” and “Private”. Only readers who have the password you set can access your blog.

## Public

What if you want your blog to be part of the larger community? A place where you not only share your writing but can read the writing shared by others? Make your blog “Public”. While still sharable by link, your posts also go into the WriteFreely site's Reader, the built-in writing hub. All posts from blogs on the site that are set to "Public" will show in the Reader.

## Defaults

The default publicity setting for blogs varies across WriteFreely sites. Some sites want blogs to be "Unlisted" by default while others "Public." This depends on the purpose of the site along with the site admin's personal preference. Knowing the default helps you understand how to adjust the publicity settings for blogs if needed.

## Multiple Blogs

If your WriteFreely site supports multiple blogs, you can have three blogs coexist with distinct or overlapping publicity types. These can be for everything from personal to work contexts.

Imagine having one blog that is your daily journal (“Private”), one blog for updates that only one person in your team can read (“Password Protected”), and then another where your articles on bug fixes can live for fellow programmers (“Unlisted”).
