# Following

Writefreely has built in ways to make it easier for people to follow your blog.

## RSS

WriteFreely blogs use RSS, allowing people to follow your blog from an RSS supported content aggregator or reader.

#### Following a Blog

To access a WriteFreely blog's RSS feed, add "/feed" to the end of the blog's url.

[blog.writefreely.org/feed/](https://blog.writefreely.org/feed/)

#### Following a Blog's Hashtag

If you want to filter a WriteFreely blog's content by hashtag, you can follow posts that only use those hashtags. All you need to do is take a blog's hashtag url and add "/feed" to the end.

[blog.writefreely.org/tag:writefreely/feed](https://blog.writefreely.org/tag:writefreely/feed/)

## Federation

WriteFreely supports federation via ActivityPub, allowing people to follow your blog from popular platforms like Mastodon (an alternative to Twitter). Learn more about how following works with Federation [here](https://writefreely.org/docs/latest/writer/federation).
