# Following a WriteFreely Blog

Writefreely has built in ways to make it easier for people to follow your blog.

## Following via RSS

WriteFreely blogs use RSS, allowing people to follow your blog from an RSS supported content aggregator or reader.

### Following a Blog via RSS

To access a WriteFreely blog's RSS feed, add "/feed/" to the end of the blog's URL.

[blog.writefreely.org/feed/](https://blog.writefreely.org/feed/)

Most feed readers will automatically detect the blog's RSS feed if you simply give them the blog URL, so you can do that too.

### Following a Blog's Hashtag via RSS

If you want to filter a WriteFreely blog's content by hashtag, you can follow posts that only use those hashtags. All you need to do is take a blog's hashtag url and add "/feed/" to the end.

[blog.writefreely.org/tag:writefreely/feed/](https://blog.writefreely.org/tag:writefreely/feed/)

## Following via ActivityPub

WriteFreely supports federation via ActivityPub, allowing people to follow your blog from popular platforms like Mastodon (an alternative to Twitter). Learn more about how following works with ActivityPub in the [Federation guide](https://writefreely.org/docs/latest/writer/federation).
