# Creating a Blog

WriteFreely makes it easy to publish multiple blogs from a single account, so you can separate your writing by audience or topic, and express yourself more freely.

## Prerequisites

First, your admin will need to configure your instance for multiple blogs (where `max_blogs` is either `0` or greater than `1`). If you're unable to create a blog with the instructions below, talk to your admin about increasing this limit.

## Getting Started

First, navigate to your _Blogs_ page. Under the list of blogs on this page, click "New blog" to start the creation process.

> **Note**: If there is no "New blog" link here, you've reached the limit of blogs you can create under one account. Talk to your admin about expanding that limit.

Enter the title or slug you want for your blog, and click the _Create_ button. A slug will contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and will comprise the URL of this new blog (e.g. `https://example.com/myblog/`). A title can contain any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, but will automatically be converted into a friendly slug.

Once you click _Create_, the new blog will appear on your _Blogs_ page. Now you can publish to it!

## Title & Alias

There are a couple things to know about your newly created blog. Each WriteFreely blog comes with an alias and a title. Both of these are taken from the name you gave your blog when you created it.

The alias is the unique and unchangeable slug in your blog's address. In the previous example, the name "Blog for Writing" creates the alias "blog-for-writing". This will appear in the URL. For example, if your WriteFreely site address is `example.com`, then your blog address will be `example.com/blog-for-writing`. The title is the name you chose displayed on the header of your blog. If you want to change your blog's title, go to your blog's _Customize_ page. At the top of the page will be a form field with your blog's current title. Change the title to what you want and then scroll down and select "Save Changes" to save the new title.

To continue upon the previous example, we can change the blog's title from "Blogs for Writing" to "Blogs for Typing". Notice how the new title appears on the blog but the alias is still "blog-for-writing":

## Identity

When you create a new blog, it is a unique, individual identity. No reader can see that your blogs come from the same writer. Only you know through your _Blogs_ page. This means that each blog can be used however you want.
