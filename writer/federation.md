# Federation

WriteFreely supports federation via ActivityPub, a protocol spoken by popular platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) (an alternative to Twitter). This means that when you enable federation for your WriteFreely blogs, they'll get their own handle that people can follow from the fediverse. 

## Finding your handle

To find your handle, go into your blog's settings. Under _URL_ will be your blog's fediverse handle, following the format blog@instance. 

## Following your blog

To follow your blog, open Mastodon and search for the fediverse handle in your settings page. Click follow and you'll start seeing future posts in your timeline, where you can favorite or boost them to your followers.

## Note about changing your username

If you change your username, a new fediverse handle will be created. The previous fediverse handle will stop being updated. Anyone who was following your previous fediverse handle will not automatically be following the new one. This means they will have to follow the new handle in order to receive your most recent posts.
