# Drafts

WriteFreely allows you to publish without a blog with “Drafts”.

## Private

Drafts are only identified by an unguessable ID, essentially making them private. Unlike posts connected to a blog, they aren't publicly connected to an identity unless you make it known in the post that you wrote it. A reader can't link your draft back to you.

## Sharing Drafts

While private by default, drafts can be shared with others. They can be shared by ID on (instance config value) ```private = false``` instances.

## Difference between Drafts & Blog Posts

Drafts differ from blog posts in a couple of ways.

While blog posts can include custom slugs for posts, drafts only have randomly generated ID's. Hashtags also won't render in drafts as they do in blog posts. Finally, drafts don't have the ability to include custom CSS like blog posts.
